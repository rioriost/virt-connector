# VirtConnector

## Overview

VirtConnector links macOS display sleep/wake events and explicit shutdown actions to Shortcuts.

VirtConnector does not directly control Apple Home or Matter devices. Device selection and control stay in Shortcuts. VirtConnector handles the macOS-side resident agent, LaunchAgent registration, event detection, and event-based Shortcut execution.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install with Homebrew Cask

```sh
brew tap rioriost/cask https://github.com/rioriost/homebrew-cask
brew install --cask rioriost/cask/virt-connector
```

For local development builds:

```sh
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install --cask rioriost/cask/virt-connector-local
```

### 2. Create Shortcuts

Create two Shortcuts in the macOS Shortcuts app for the Home/Matter device you want to control.

- `TurnOnLED`: turns on `LED Strip`
- `TurnOffLED`: turns off `LED Strip`

Verify them from Terminal:

```sh
shortcuts run TurnOnLED
shortcuts run TurnOffLED
```

### 3. Set Up VirtConnector

```sh
virt-connector setup --device "LED Strip" --on TurnOnLED --off TurnOffLED
```

This creates or updates:

- `~/.config/virt-connector/config.json`
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/st.rio.virt-connectord.plist`
- the running user LaunchAgent for `VirtConnectorAgent`
- the VirtConnector power icon in the menu bar

After setup, display sleep/wake runs `TurnOffLED`/`TurnOnLED`.

For reliable shutdown-time LED-off behavior, use the VirtConnector menu bar item `Shut Down...` instead of the Apple menu shutdown item. VirtConnector runs configured `power_off` actions first, then asks macOS to shut down.

Japanese documentation is available in [README-ja.md](README-ja.md).

## Components

- `virt-connector`
  - CLI for setup, device management, LaunchAgent management, manual tests, and shutdown.
- `VirtConnectorAgent.app`
  - Resident agent that contains `virt-connectord`.
  - Runs in the user's Aqua session as a LaunchAgent.
  - Provides the menu bar icon and `Shut Down...` menu item.
- `virt-connectord`
  - Executable inside `VirtConnectorAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/virt-connectord`.
  - `/usr/local/bin/virt-connectord` is a symlink to this executable.

`virt-connectord` runs outside the App Sandbox, so it can use the same `pmset -g log` approach as the original shell script.

## Events

- `display_on`
  - The latest `pmset -g log` display entry contains `Display is turned on`.
- `display_off`
  - The latest `pmset -g log` display entry contains `Display is turned off`.
- `power_off`
  - Triggered when shutdown is explicitly started from the VirtConnector menu bar item or `virt-connector shutdown`.
  - Apple menu shutdown and LaunchAgent `SIGTERM` are handled best-effort, but Shortcuts may already be unavailable by that phase.

Each device can choose `on`, `off`, or `none` for each event.

Default actions for the first configured device:

- `display_on`: `on`
- `display_off`: `off`
- `power_off`: `off`

## Installed Files

The Homebrew Cask installs a pkg that places:

```text
/Library/VirtConnector/bin/virt-connector
/Library/VirtConnector/VirtConnectorAgent.app
/Library/VirtConnector/VirtConnectorAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/virt-connectord
/usr/local/bin/virt-connector -> /Library/VirtConnector/bin/virt-connector
/usr/local/bin/virt-connectord -> /Library/VirtConnector/VirtConnectorAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/virt-connectord
```

Installing the pkg does not register or start the LaunchAgent. The user explicitly enables the agent with:

```sh
virt-connector setup
```

Do not run `sudo virt-connector setup`. The LaunchAgent must be registered for the logged-in user and Aqua session. The CLI rejects sudo execution.

## Shortcuts

VirtConnector delegates all device control to Shortcuts.

For example, to control `LED Strip`, create:

- `TurnOnLED`
  - Turns on `LED Strip` in Home.
- `TurnOffLED`
  - Turns off `LED Strip` in Home.

Shortcut names are arbitrary. Use the names you pass to `setup` or `device add`.

List available Shortcuts:

```sh
virt-connector shortcuts
```

## Setup

Default setup creates one device named `LED Strip` using `TurnOnLED` and `TurnOffLED`.

```sh
virt-connector setup
```

Explicit device and Shortcut names:

```sh
virt-connector setup --device "LED Strip" --on TurnOnLED --off TurnOffLED
```

Config file:

```text
~/.config/virt-connector/config.json
```

LaunchAgent plist:

```text
~/Library/LaunchAgents/st.rio.virt-connectord.plist
```

Logs:

```text
~/Library/Logs/virt-connectord.log
~/Library/Logs/virt-connectord.out.log
~/Library/Logs/virt-connectord.err.log
```

For tests and local development, override paths with:

```sh
export VIRT_CONNECTOR_CONFIG=/tmp/virt-connector/config.json
export VIRT_CONNECTOR_LOG_DIR=/tmp/virt-connector/logs
export VIRT_CONNECTOR_LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR=/tmp/virt-connector/LaunchAgents
```

## Device Configuration

List devices:

```sh
virt-connector devices
```

Add a device:

```sh
virt-connector device add "LED Strip" \
  --on TurnOnLED \
  --off TurnOffLED \
  --display-on on \
  --display-off off \
  --power-off off
```

Change event actions:

```sh
virt-connector device set "LED Strip" \
  --display-on on \
  --display-off off \
  --power-off off
```

Valid actions:

- `on`
  - Runs the device's `--on` Shortcut.
- `off`
  - Runs the device's `--off` Shortcut.
- `none`
  - Does nothing for that event.

Remove a device:

```sh
virt-connector device remove "LED Strip"
```

Disable all automation:

```sh
virt-connector disable
```

Enable again:

```sh
virt-connector enable
```

## Manual Testing

Run configured actions without waiting for macOS events:

```sh
virt-connector run display-on
virt-connector run display-off
virt-connector run power-off
```

Check status:

```sh
virt-connector status
```

## Shutdown

For reliable `power_off` actions, use either:

- the VirtConnector menu bar item `Shut Down...`
- `virt-connector shutdown`

CLI:

```sh
virt-connector shutdown
```

This runs configured `power_off` actions, then asks macOS to shut down through System Events.

Apple menu shutdown is handled best-effort, but during macOS shutdown Shortcuts may already be unavailable. Use the VirtConnector menu or `virt-connector shutdown` when reliable LED-off behavior is required.

The menu bar UI switches between English and Japanese using `AppleLanguages`, via `Locale.preferredLanguages`.

## LaunchAgent Management

Restart the LaunchAgent:

```sh
virt-connector restart-agent
```

Remove the LaunchAgent:

```sh
virt-connector uninstall-agent
```

Install with an explicit daemon path:

```sh
virt-connector install-agent --daemon /path/to/virt-connectord
```

For normal Cask installs, `setup` automatically detects `/Library/VirtConnector/VirtConnectorAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/virt-connectord`.

## Homebrew Cask Distribution

The public release artifact is expected to be a signed, notarized, and stapled pkg:

```text
VirtConnector-<version>-signed.pkg
```

Cask definition:

```text
Casks/virt-connector.rb
```

The Cask URL assumes GitHub Releases:

```text
https://github.com/rioriost/virt-connector/releases/download/v#{version}/VirtConnector-#{version}-signed.pkg
```

The Cask is published in the `rioriost/homebrew-cask` tap.

## Packaging

Unsigned pkg for local testing:

```sh
scripts/build-pkg.sh --unsigned
```

Signed pkg requires these certificates in the login keychain:

- `Developer ID Application`
- `Developer ID Installer`

```sh
DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
DEVELOPER_ID_INSTALLER="Developer ID Installer: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
scripts/build-pkg.sh
```

Store notarytool credentials:

```sh
APPLE_ID=you@example.com \
APPLE_TEAM_ID=TEAMID \
APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
scripts/notarytool-store-credentials.sh virt-connector-notary
```

Notarize and staple:

```sh
DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
DEVELOPER_ID_INSTALLER="Developer ID Installer: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE=virt-connector-notary \
scripts/build-pkg.sh --notarize
```

Update the Cask SHA256:

```sh
VERSION=0.1.0 scripts/update-cask.sh dist/VirtConnector-0.1.0-signed.pkg
```

## Homebrew Formula

`Formula/virt-connector.rb` is included for source builds with Homebrew.

The intended distribution path for users is the Cask. The Cask can install `VirtConnectorAgent.app` through a pkg and is the right shape for a notarized macOS app-like tool.

## Build

```sh
swift build
swift build -c release
```
